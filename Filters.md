**ViewModel Integration (FiltersViewModel)**

_The FiltersViewModel manages data and interactions on the Filters page. It handles the loading of filter authors and their respective filters, selection actions by the user, and applying the chosen filter to the game.
Key Properties and Commands_

    AuthorsList and FiltersList: Bind to the ListBox controls on the UI, displaying the available authors and filters.
    SelectedAuthor and SelectedFilter: Track the user's current selections. Changing these properties triggers updates in the UI and potentially fetches new data.

**Functionality**

_Upon initialization, the ViewModel fetches and displays a list of filter authors. When an author is selected, their available filters are loaded into the Filters List. Selecting a filter enables the "Save Filter" button, allowing the user to apply it. The ViewModel interacts with a FilterHelpers class to manage the fetching, storing, and application of filters, ensuring the game uses the user's selected preferences._

**Additional Notes**

_The Filters page leverages external data (fetched from GitHub) to populate the list of authors and filters. It supports adding local filters by scanning a predefined directory and integrating them into the UI for selection alongside online filters._
